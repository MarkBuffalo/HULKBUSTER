# HULKBUSTER


## What does it do?

Checks if the Rogue Fitness grab bags and other products are in stock, and tells you which ones are in stock, then opens a web browser and plays an alarm.

# Install
```
git clone https://github.com/MarkBuffalo/HULKBUSTER.git
cd HULKBUSTER 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
You now need to edit `products.txt`. Visit roguefitness.com and add products you want to search to products.txt, separated by new lines.


# Run 
```
$ python3 hulkbuster.py
```
